## Working with Alternative Build Systems
### droidcon San Francisco 2019

Uber, Google & Facebook use Buck and Bazel to work with large codebases. In this talk you will learn how these alternative build systems impact both the developer experience and the performance of builds. You will also learn if, when and how you should switch to them for your own codebase.
